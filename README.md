JARVIS
======

JARVIS was coded for the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon 2013 in New York City in close cooperation with Ninja Blocks.
The Node.js app utilizes the Twilio API (for speech recognition and text-to-speech) and the Ninja Blocks REST Interface
to create a simple, yet cool voice interface for the Internet of Things. In essence, this script allows you to give your
home your own JARVIS - as in a virtual assistant with a British accent, who's able to understand what is happening in
your home.

The version released here is heavily scripted an merely demos the capabilities, missing an effective routing mechanism.
